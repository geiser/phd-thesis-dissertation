An analysis of the current status of AI-ED research is done in the light of intelligence, conceptualization, standardization and theory-awareness. Following this, an ontology-based architecture with appropriate ontologies is proposed. Ontological engineering of IS/ID is next discussed followed by a road map towards an ontology-aware authoring system. Heuristic design patterns and XML-based documentation are also discussed.  1. INTRODUCTION  Among AI-ED research done to date, several paradigms such as CAI, ICAI, Micro-world, ITS, ILE, and CSCL have been proposed and many systems have been built within each paradigm. Additionally, innovative computer technologies such as hyper-media, virtual reality, internet, WWW have significantly affected the AI-ED community in general. We really have learned a lot ...},

In this research we tried to gain insights into ways of improving our teaching by a careful examination of students' mistakes. The compiler errors that were generated by their programs together with the pattern that was observed in their debugging activities formed the basis of this research. We discovered that many students with a good understanding of programming do not acquire the skills to debug programs effectively, and this is a major impediment to their producing working code of any complexity. Skill at debugging seems to increase a programmer's confidence and we suggest that more emphasis be placed on debugging skills in the teaching of programming.},

They look at games through a series of eighteen "game design schemas," or conceptual frameworks, including games as systems of emergence and information, as contexts for social play, as a storytelling medium, and as sites of cultural resistance.Written for game scholars, game developers, and interactive designers, Rules of Play is a textbook, reference book, and theoretical guide. It is the first comprehensive attempt to establish a solid theoretical framework for the emerging discipline of game design.},

After defining class, instance andis-a relation, we point out some typical inappropriate uses ofis-a relation in existing ontologies and analyze the reasons why. Other topics are basic ontological distinction, part-of relation, and so on. As an advanced example of ontology, an ontology of representation is extensively discussed. To conclude this tutorial, a success story of ontological engineering is presented. It is concerned with a new kind of application of ontology, that is, knowledge systematization.

ABSTRACT

Gamification is fundamentally rewriting the rules of engagement for product design and marketing. From Foursquare to Farmville and from Nike to the Navy, game mechanics like points, badges, levels, challenges, rewards and leaderboards are being used in ever greater numbers. But what does this mean for "traditional" marketing \& UI/UX and how do you leverage this trend in your engagement strategy? Moreover, how do we measure success, and why will every company have a Chief Engagement Officer in the next few years? Find out more in this in-depth discussion with Gamification Expert, Gabe Zichermann -- author of "Game-Based Marketing" and the Gamification.co blog, and Chair of the Gamification Summit.

GABE ZICHERMANN is an author, highly rated public speaker and serial entrepreneur. His most recent book,Game-Based Marketing (Wiley, 4/2010) has achieved critical and industry acclaim for its detailed look at innovators who blend the power of games with brand strategy. His next book on game mechanics is a detailed technical look at architecture and implementation. Gabe is also the Chair of the Gamification Workshops and Summit, upcoming events that bring together the leading minds in Gamification and Engagement Science - http://gsummit.com. A resident of NYC, Gabe is a board member of StartOut.org, advisor to a number of startups and Facilitator for the NYC chapter of the Founder Institute.},

Affective states and capacity to self-regulate learning were compared among learners with varying academic interests, experiences, and proficiencies. Demotivating factors were grouped into three categories: external conditions of the learning environment, internal conditions of the learner, and reactive behaviors to demotivating experiences. Internal and reactive factors were shown to correlate with long-term EFL learning outcomes. Findings from this study indicated that beginning, less-proficient learners in non-English majors were least likely to control their affective states to cope with demotivating experiences. Finally, this paper discusses steps that might prevent or minimize demotivation and facilitate remotivation.},

  abstract = {Collaborative learning has a number of potential benefits, which do not always occur, partially due to the difficulties that students and teachers have to establish good social interaction patterns. These interaction patterns depend on the roles assumed by participants in the learning process. In real practice, teachers need support to be able to detect these emergent roles and undesired interaction patterns, especially if collaboration is mediated by computers, and thus is not directly observable by humans. Interaction analysis (IA) methods and tools are adequate to support the regulation of the collaborative activities, using the analysis results to provide adequate feedback to the different participants in their specific roles. We have proposed a role-based approach supported by a tool called Role-AdaptIA to detect and help to solve problematic situations in authentic computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) scenarios. Role-AdaptIA is an adaptive interaction analysis tool based on a theoretical framework for the description of roles. The framework permits to define and characterize the roles to take into account in a given situation. Based on this information, Role-AdaptIA automatically detects role changes during the development of the collaborative experiences and warns the teacher about these changes. With this advice, the teacher is able to regulate the collaboration, providing support to the students to improve their interaction patterns. This chapter presents four examples of how Role-AdaptIA was used by teachers in order to regulate collaboration, detecting and solving undesired collaborative situations in several University courses where we have applied CSCL methods during the last years.},

The main point is that reusability across multiple tasks or methods can and should be systematically pursued even when modelling knowledge related to a single task or method. Under this view, I discuss how the principles of formal ontology and ontological engineering can be used in the practice of knowledge engineering, focusing in particular on the interplay between general ontologies, method ontologies and application ontologies, and on the role of ontologies in the knowledge engineering process. I will then stress the role of domain analysis, often absent in current methodologies for the development of knowledge-based systems.},

Nevertheless, the specification of the data flow between tools is an open issue in IMS-LD, especially in collaborative learning. In such case, handling shared data derived from individual and collaborative tools is error-prone for learners who suffer an extra cognitive load. Additionally, problems in the collaborative data flow specification affect the reusability of the whole learning design. In this paper, we present LeadFlow4LD, a solution of specification and enactment for LD in CSCL in order to address the aforementioned issues in an interoperable and standard way. Such a solution is based on approaches for the composition of the activity flow specified in IMS-LD and the data flow specified in a standard workflow language, such as BPEL. An architecture and a prototype for validating the propose solution through a case study based on a significant CSCL situation are also presented.},

A specification of a representational vocabulary for a shared domain of discourse\textemdash{}definitions of classes, relations, functions, and other objects\textemdash{}is called an ontology. This paper describes a mechanism for defining ontologies that are portable over representation systems. Definitions written in a standard format for predicate calculus are translated by a system called Ontolingua into specialized representations, including frame-based systems as well as relational languages. This allows researchers to share and reuse ontologies, while retaining the computational benefits of specialized implementations.

We discuss how the translation approach to portability addresses several technical problems. One problem is how to accommodate the stylistic and organizational differences among representations while preserving declarative content. Another is how to translate from a very expressive language into restricted languages, remaining system-independent while preserving the computational efficiency of implemented systems. We describe how these problems are addressed by basing Ontolingua itself on an ontology of domain-independent, representational idioms.},

Gamification, understood as the use of game design elements in other contexts for the purpose of engagement, has become a hot topic in the recent years. However, there's also a cautionary tale to be extracted from Gartner's reports on the topic: many gamification-based solutions fail because, mostly, they have been created on a whim, or mixing bits and pieces from game components, without a clear and formal design process. The application of a definite design framework aims to be a path to success. Therefore, before starting the gamification of a process, it is very important to know which frameworks or methods exist and their main characteristics. The present review synthesizes the process of gamification design for a successful engagement experience. This review categorizes existing approaches and provides an assessment of their main features, which may prove invaluable to developers of gamified solutions at different levels and scopes.},

In the case study described, 33 students made 6,152 contributions during a six-month part-time online continuing education course. Findings suggest that the number of `experience points' a student earns on the platform is highly correlated with the average assignment mark they achieve (r = 0.499 n = 33). The results suggest that gamification can help improve the learning experience and the resulting performance for groups of students. There are limitations to this finding. Within the group there are cases where contribution and resulting performance do not correlate. Further work assessing the quality of contributions is suggested to understand this effect better.},

  abstract = {One of the main difficulties during the design of collaborative learning activities is adequate group formation. In any type of collaboration, group formation plays a critical role in the learners' acceptance of group activities, as well as the success of the collaborative learning process. Nevertheless, to propose both an effective and pedagogically sound group formation is a complex issue due to multiple factors that influence group arrangement. The current (and previous) learner's knowledge and skills, the roles and strategies used by learners to interact among themselves, and the teacher's preferences are some examples of factors to be considered while forming groups. To identify which factors are essential (or desired) in effective group formation, a well-structured and formalized representation of collaborative learning processes, supported by a strong pedagogical basis, is desirable. Thus, the main goal of this paper is to present an ontology that works as a framework based on learning theories that facilitate group formation and collaborative learning design. The ontology provides the necessary formalization to represent collaborative learning and its processes, while learning theories provide support in making pedagogical decisions such as gathering learners in groups and planning the scenario where the collaboration will take place. Although the use of learning theories to support collaborative learning is open for criticism, we identify that they provide important information which can be useful in allowing for more effective learning. To validate the usefulness and effectiveness of this approach, we use this ontology to form and run group activities carried out by four instructors and 20 participants. The experiment was utilized as a proof-of-concept and the results suggest that our ontological framework facilitates the effective design of group activities, and can positively affect the performance of individuals during group learning.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.eswa.2013.12.016},
  abstract = {In Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), one of the most important tasks for instructional designers is to define scenarios that foster group learning. Such scenarios, defined as Units of Learning (UoLs), comprise different components and are organized according to pedagogical approaches to orchestrate group learning processes. Examples of UoL components are learning objects, student roles, student characteristics (e.g., background, preferences, learning styles, etc.), instructional/learning goals, and activities, among others. Thus, the instructional design (ID) of a proper UoL for CSCL is a complex task that requires practice and experience. This is particularly true when designing, developing, adapting, and customizing UoLs, taking into consideration different instructional/learning goals and individual preferences of students. This paper therefore proposes using a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning approach to automate and optimize the tasks of designers. To accomplish that, we define an initial CSCL scenario as ``an ID task'' and ``a set of information related to students and the domain to be taught.'' Then we propose a model that formally describes ID for CSCL as HTN planning, where the initial CSCL scenario is adapted and refined according to student needs. In this model, the ID strategies are defined as hierarchical tasks and methods into a planning domain definition, and the initial CSCL scenario is defined as a planning problem definition. To validate our approach, we develop a CSCL courseware generator that (i) helps designers to set up an initial CSCL scenario; (ii) automatically generates a personalized UoL based on a given initial scenario; and (iii) supports the adaptation of UoLs.},

It may seem that it is not very difficult to describe the application of a relatively young technology, such as the Semantic Web, to the domain of education. It may seem that there is actually not much to write about that topic. But it just seems so. On the contrary, the greatest challenge in writing this book was the abundance of material and exciting ideas about how to apply Semantic Web technologies to education. I knew from the very beginning that I will have to select carefully from many theories, practices, evolving ideas and approaches, and important research efforts, in order to compose a coherent whole. Worse still, I also knew that I will have to leave out of the book many other results, initiatives, and ongoing projects that would certainly be worth describing under more relaxed constraints. Thus, the endeavor was exhausting. The Semantic Web is about how to deploy artificial intelligence concepts and techniques on the Web, in order to harness the Web and make it more useful, more user-centered, and more responsive to human interaction.},

The key principle in learning design is that it represents the learning activities and the support activities that are performed by different persons (learners, teachers) in the context of a unit of learning. The IMS Learning Design specification aims to represent the learning design of units of learning in a semantic, formal and machine interpretable way. Since its release in 2003 various parties have been active to develop tools, to experiment with Learning Design in practice, or to do research on the further advancement of the specification. The aim of this special issue is to provide an overview of current work in the area. This papers introduces Learning Design, analyses the different papers and provides an overview of current research in Learning Design. The major research issues are at the moment: a) the use of ontologies and semantic web principles \& tools related to Learning Design; b) the use of learning design patterns; c) the development of learrning design authoring and content management systems, and d) the development of learning design players, including the issues how to use the integrated set of learning design tools in a variety of settings.},

  abstract = {As video games, particularly, social games are growing in popularity and number of users, there has been an increasing interest in its potential as innovative teaching tools. Gamification is a new concept intending to use elements from video games in non-game applications. Education is an area with high potential for application of this concept since it seeks to promote people's motivation and engagement. The research in progress will try to find how to apply social gamification in education, testing and validating the results of that application. To fulfil these objectives, this paper presents the guidelines and main features of a social gamification framework to be applied in an existent K-6 social learning environment.},

This paper presents GLUE!, an architecture that enables the lightweight integration of multiple existing external tools in multiple existing VLEs. GLUE! fosters this integration by imposing few restrictions on VLE and tool providers, as well as by requiring an attainable effort from developers, unlike other integration works. Besides, GLUE! facilitates the instantiation and enactment of collaborative activities within VLEs, leveraging the VLEs distinctive features for the management of users and groups. GLUE! has been evaluated using three authentic collaborative learning situations, instantiated and enacted by real practitioners at university level. The results of this evaluation show that GLUE! reduces the burden of educators when instantiating collaborative activities that require the integration of external tools, while facilitates students the realization of these activities in collaboration. Interestingly, the development effort required by the integration software is similar to that in other lightweight generic approaches that offer a lower degree of functionality.},

  abstract = {Gamification is a term that refers to the use of game elements in non-game contexts with the goal of engaging people in a variety of tasks. There is a growing interest in gamification as well as its applications and implications in the field of Education since it provides an alternative to engage and motivate students during the process of learning. Despite this increasing interest, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies that cover and classify the types of research being published and the most investigated topics in the area. As a first step towards bridging this gap, we carried out a systematic mapping to synthesize an overview of the area. We went through 357 papers on gamification. Among them, 48 were related to education and only 26 met the criteria for inclusion and exclusion of articles defined in this study. These 26 papers were selected and categorized according to their contribution. As a result, we provide an overview of the area. Such an overview suggests that most studies focus on investigating how gamification can be used to motivate students, improve their skills, and maximize learning.},

Designers are also aided in the selection and application of widely accepted assessment techniques, by means of the application of assessment design patterns. The support of Web Collage to the design of CSCL scripts with assessments was evaluated in two studies, in which non-expert practitioners and experts drawn from the CSCL research community, respectively, assumed the role of script designers. The results indicate that the Web Collage successfully supports the task of assessment design for non-expert users, while they point out new research and development lines.},

  volume = {2},
  issn = {1570-5838},
  abstract = {One of the major goals of ontology is to represent properly the underlying conceptual structure of the messy world reflecting the reality as much as possible. Ontology building tools should be designed to help developers create good ontologies. However, few of them can deal with roles adequately. Needless to say, the world is full of roles (e.g., wife, teacher, president, fuel, food, product, output, height) although there has been extensive theoretical research on roles, we do not yet have a comprehensive and usable theory yet. Our group has already constructed an ontology-development tool known as Hozo which has the ability to deal with roles. However, although Hozo allows users to represent roles better than other existing tools, the underlying theoretical foundations are still unclear and there is some room for improvement concerning the generality of how to deal with roles. In this paper, as an extension of the Hozo framework for roles, we present a framework for organizing role concepts according to their context dependencies. We also focus on the clarification of role properties and requirements on the model of roles and on the feedback obtained from Hozo-based ontology building experiences. Establishment of a computational model of roles contributes to building good ontologies because such a theory would provide useful guidelines for dealing with view-related and context-dependent distinctions related to roles.},

  abstract = {The design of collaborative learning (CL) scenarios that increase both students' learning and motivation is a challenge that the CSCL community has been addressing in the past few years. On one hand, CSCL design (i.e. scripts) has been shown to be effective to support meaningful interactions and better learning. On the other hand, scripted collaboration often does not motivate students to participate in the CL process, which makes more difficult the use of group activities over time. To deal with the problem of motivation, researchers and educators are now looking at gamification techniques to engage students. Gamification is an interesting concept that deals with the introduction and use of game design elements in a proper way to satisfy individual motivational needs. The use of gamification in educational settings is a complex task that requires, from instructional designers, knowledge about game elements (such as leaderboards and point systems), game design (e.g. how to combine game elements) and their impact on motivation and learning. Today, to the best of our knowledge, there are no approaches for the formal systematization of the instructional design knowledge about gamification and its application in CL scenarios. Thus, to address this issue, we have applied ontological engineering techniques to develop an Ontology called OntoGaCLeS. In this paper, we present the main concepts and ontological structure used to represent gamified CL scenarios. In this ontology, we formalize the representation of gamification concepts and explain how they affect motivation in the context of collaborative learning. Particularly, we will focus on the definition of player roles and gameplay strategies. Furthermore, to show the utility of our approach, we illustrate how to use our ontology to define a personalized gamification model that is used to gamify a CL scenario based on motivational needs and individual traits of learners in a group.},

To support the creation of CL scenarios this paper presents an intelligent authoring tool that is equipped with the knowledge about different pedagogies and practices related to collaboration. Through the use of this information, the tool can provide intelligent guidance that support designers to create more effective CL scenarios.

  abstract = {One-to-one technology classrooms equip each child with a computing device that provides personalised learning tools. One-to-one learning is showing promise in classrooms due to support for individual and small group learning through the affordances of mobile learning devices such as portability, low cost and communication features. However, there are problems of management of the technology-enabled classroom, lack of support for collaborative and whole class working, design of lessons that switch easily between activities, and difficulty in re-use of lesson components. In this chapter we describe the SceDer system to orchestrate learning with one-to-one technologies. Sceder provides an authoring system for teachers to design lessons, an interchange language (COML) to describe lesson sequences and resources, and a delivery system that enables the teacher to manage collaborative one-to-one learning in the classroom. The system has been tested in school classrooms and has demonstrated its effectiveness in managing fluid transitions between individual, group, and whole class learning activities.},

However, little is known about how different students experience and are engaged by it. We present a long-term study which identified distinct behavioral and performance patterns in participants taking a gamified college course. Our study lasted for three years, during which we deployed three consecutive instances of the course, each featuring improvements based on student feedback from the previous instances. To understand how different students behaved in our gamified experience, according to their daily performance, we performed cluster analysis and assessed student engagement in the last year using a formal instrument. We then did a cluster-wise analysis using different performance and behavioral measures, to further assess and characterize every cluster. To wit, we identified six different student clusters, each featuring different behaviors and performance levels. However, only four were present in the last year, which differed in terms of engagement with the course. In this paper we carefully describe each student cluster, explain how they evolved, and derive meaningful design lessons.},

To incorporate the theory in a design, automatic detector of flow is required.

Hence, within this paper, we present an automated detector which is able to identify the students that are in flow.

  abstract = {The design of collaborative learning (CL) scenarios that increase both students' learning and motivation is a challenge that the Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) community has been addressing in the past few years. On one hand, CSCL design (i.e. scripts) has shown to be an effective approach to support meaningful interactions and better learning. On the other hand, scripted collaboration sometimes decrease motivation of students to participate in the CL process, which makes more difficult the use of group activities over time. To deal with the problem of motivation, researchers and educators are now looking at Gamification techniques to engage students. Gamification in education is a complex task that requires, from instructional designers, knowledge about game elements (such as leaderboards and point systems), game design (how to combine game elements) and their impact on motivation and learning. To help the adequate use of gamification in collaborative learning activities we have applied ontological engineering techniques to develop an Ontology called OntoGaCLeS in order to formalize the representation of gamification concepts and explain how they affect motivation in CL situations. This paper will present the ontological structure to represent gamified CL scenarios and show the utility of our approach to define personalized conceptual models to gamify CL scenario based on students' needs and individual characteristics.},

  abstract = {When the goal of group activities is to support long-term learning, the task of designing well-thought-out collaborative learning (CL) scenarios is an important key to success. To help students adequately acquire and develop their knowledge and skills, a teacher can plan a scenario that increases the probability for learning to occur. Such a scenario defines pedagogically sound structures that prevent off-task behavior and engage students in more meaningful interactions. The main difficulty in designing effective CL scenarios is transforming the teacher's intentions into elements that constitute the learning scenario. This problem is frequently observed when novice teachers attempt to improve the quality of learning and instruction by blending collaborative activities with individual activities without careful planning. With the goal of helping teachers in planning collaborative scenarios, we have developed an intelligent authoring tool referred to as CHOCOLATO using Semantic Web technologies (e.g. ontologies) in order to represent knowledge about different pedagogies and practices related to collaboration. Through the use of this knowledge, CHOCOLATO can provide intelligent guidance that helps teachers to create theory-based CL scenarios which has proven to be effective in a variety of situations. We evaluated it by conducting two experiments. We were interested in verifying whether the recommendations given by CHOCOLATO help novice teachers to design pedagogically sound CL activities, and if these activities help students to learn collaboratively in real classroom settings. The first experiment had the participation of 58 pre-service teachers that created CL scenarios with and without our authoring tool and the second experiment was carried out in a Brazilian public school together with 218 students. The results suggest that the guidance provided by CHOCOLATO do help novice teachers plan, understand and share CL scenarios more easily. They also suggest that the continuous utilization of well-designed theory-based CL activities create favorable conditions for students (particularly less knowledgeable ones) to improve their overall performance throughout the school year.},

We start with a review of theories that highlight motivational mechanisms that are internal to the person. The rational theories like expectance theory, self-efficacy, and goal setting are contrasted with the nonrational approaches that focus on personality and emotions. We then discuss theories that focus more on social or external factors that motivate individuals. Included here are justice and reinforcement theories. We close with a discussion of the ways that these motivational approaches could be organized using different perspectives than the tension idea. Included here are discussions of the extent to which theories have a future, past, or present time perspective; the extent to which the motivational process is seen as malleable; and the ease with which the approaches can be implemented in organizations.},

As the book shows, designing for fun is all about making interactive products like games highly entertaining, engaging, and addictive. The book's unique approach of providing a highly visual storyboard approach combined with a narrative on the art and practice of designing for fun is sure to be a hit with game and interactive designers, At first glance A Theory of Fun for Game Design is a book that will truly inspire and challenge game designers to think in new was; however, its universal message will influence designers from all walks of life. This book captures the real essence of what drives us to seek out products and experiences that are truly fun and entertaining. The author masterfully presents his engaging theory by showing readers how many designs are lacking because they are predictable and not engaging enough. He then explains how great designers use different types of elements in new ways to make designs more fun and compelling. Anyone who is interested in design will enjoy how the book works on two levels--as a quick inspiration guide to game design, or as an informative discussion that details the insightful thinking from a great mind in the game industry.},

  abstract = {Three decades of active research on the teaching of introductory programming has had limited effect on classroom practice. Although relevant research exists across several disciplines including education and cognitive science, disciplinary differences have made this material inaccessible to many computing educators. Furthermore, computer science instructors have not had access to a comprehensive survey of research in this area. This paper collects and classifies this literature, identifies important work and mediates it to computing educators and professional bodies. We identify research that gives well-supported advice to computing academics teaching introductory programming. Limitations and areas of incomplete coverage of existing research efforts are also identified. The analysis applies publication and research quality metrics developed by a previous ITiCSE working group [74].},

This paper reports on research that uses the constructs of flow to explore learning in an online environment. An experiment was carried out in which students worked through a learning sequence in the physics domain that had varying degrees of interactivity. Their interactions and flow states were monitored throughout the learning task. The experimental data suggest that flow can be more usefully regarded as a process rather than just an overall state. This process is represented by flow-paths that plot each student's progress through challenge-skill space. Some flow patterns are identified that relate to the learning outcomes of the students. While there is some conflict between this process representation and outcome measures for flow, this flow-path portrayal has provided fresh insights into students' interactions in online learning environments.},

The use of visual representations supports both the understanding of the design ideas and the usability of the authoring tool. This paper presents a multicase study comprising three different cases that evaluate the approach from different perspectives. The first case includes workshops where teachers use Collage. A second case implies the design of a scenario proposed by a third-party using related approaches. The third case analyzes a situation where students follow a design created with Collage.

Novice programmers for 4th-grade classes were given three sessions of Logo learning, with a Logo test given after each session, and a test of spatial cognition given before and after learning. Children showed a general increase in their knowledge of Logo across the three sessions, as indicated by increasing proportions of correct answers on the Logo test. Children showed a reduction in their misconceptions related to Logo, namely, egocentric bugs such as thinking "turn right" means to turn to the right side of the screen rather than to the turtle's right, and interpretation bugs such as thinking "turn right" means to turn and then keep moving. Children who lost their egocentric misconceptions or who never had them showed pretest-to-posttest gains on a test of spatial cognition, whereas egocentric children did not. Results provide some preliminary evidence that productive learning of a programming language involves a chain of cognitive changes, with lower-level changes facilitating higher-level changes.},

  shorttitle = {{{DESIGN FOR BEHAVIOUR CHANGE}}},
  abstract = {People generally want to engage in a healthy lifestyle, to live in harmony with the environment, to contribute to social causes, and to avoid behaviours that are harmful for themselves and others. However, people often find it difficult to motivate themselves to engage in these beneficial behaviours. Even adopting a healthy lifestyle, such as healthy eating, physical activity, or smoking cessation, is hard despite being aware of the benefits. The increasing adoption and integration of technologies into our daily lives present unique opportunities to assist individuals to adopt healthy behaviours using technology. As a result, research on how to use technology to motivate health behaviour change has attracted the attention of both researchers and health practitioners. Technology designed for the purpose of bringing about desirable behaviour and attitude changes is referred to as Persuasive Technology (PT). Over the past decade, several PTs have been developed to motivate healthy behaviour, including helping people with addictive behaviour such as substance abuse, assisting individuals to achieve personal wellness, helping people manage diseases, and engaging people in preventive behaviours. Most of these PTs take a one-size-fits-all design approach. However, people differ in their motivation and beliefs about health and what constitutes a healthy life. A technology that motivates one type of person to change her behaviour may actually deter behaviour change for another type of person. As a result, existing PTs that are based on the one-size-fits-all approach may not be effective for promoting healthy behaviour change for most people. 
Because of the motivational pull that games offer, many PTs deliver their intervention in the form of games. This type of game-based PTs are referred to as persuasive games. Considering the increasing interest in delivering PT as a game, this dissertation uses persuasive games as a case study to illustrate the danger of applying the one-size-fits-all approach, the value and importance of tailoring PT, and to propose an approach for tailoring PTs to increase their efficacy. 
To address the problem that most existing PTs employ the one-size-fits-all design approach, I developed the Model-driven Persuasive Technology (MPT) design approach for tailoring PTs to various user types. The MPT is based on studying and modelling user's behaviour with respect to their motivations. I developed the MPT approach in two preliminary studies (N = 221, N = 554) that model the determinants of healthy eating for people from different cultures, of different ages, and of both genders. I then applied the MPT approach in two large-scale studies to develop models for tailoring persuasive games to various gamer types. In the first study (N = 642), I examine eating behaviours and associated determinants, using the Health Belief Model. Using  data from the study, I modelled the determinants of healthy eating behaviour for various gamer types. In the second study (N = 1108), I examined the persuasiveness of PT design strategies and developed models for tailoring the strategies to various gamer types. Behavioural determinants and PT design strategies are the two fundamental building blocks that drive PT interventions.  The models revealed that some strategies were more effective for particular gamer types, thus, providing guidelines for tailoring persuasive games to various gamer types.
To show the feasibility of the MPT design approach, I applied the model to design and develop two versions of a Model-driven Persuasive Game (MPG) targeting two distinct gamer types. To demonstrate the importance of tailoring persuasive games using the MPG approach, I conducted a large-scale evaluation (N = 802) of the two versions of the game and compared the efficacy of the tailored, contra-tailored, and the one-size-fits-all persuasive games condition with respect to their ability to promote positive changes in attitude, self-efficacy, and intention. To also demonstrate that the tailored MPG games inspire better play experience than the one-size-fits-all and the contra-tailored persuasive games, I measure the gamers' perceived enjoyment and competence under the different game conditions.
The results of the evaluation showed that while PTs can be effective for promoting healthy behaviour in terms of attitude, self-efficacy, and intention, the effectiveness of persuasion depends on using the right choice of persuasive strategy for each gamer type. The results showed that one size does not fit all and answered my overarching research question of whether there is a value in tailoring PT to an individual or group. The answer is that persuasive health interventions are more effective if they are tailored to the user types under consideration and that not tailoring PTs could be detrimental to behaviour change.},

  abstract = {The explosive growth of Web-based social applications over the last 10 years has led people to engage in online communities for various purposes: to work, learn, play, share time and mementos with friends and family and engage in public action. Social Computing Applications (SCA) allow users to discuss various topics in online forums, share their thoughts in blogs, share photos, videos, bookmarks, and connect with friends through social networks. Yet, the design of successful social applications that attract and sustain active contribution by their users still remains more of an art than a science. My research over the last 10 years has been based on the hypothesis that it is possible to incorporate mechanisms and tools in the design of the social application that can motivate users to participate, and more generally, to change their behavior in a desirable way, which is beneficial for the community. Since different people are motivated by different things, it can be expected that personalizing the incentives and the way the rewards are presented to the individual, would be beneficial. Also since communities have different needs in different phases of their existence, it is necessary to model the changing needs of communities and adapt the incentive mechanisms accordingly, to attract the kind of contributions that are beneficial. Therefore User and Group (Community) Modeling is an important area in the design of incentive mechanisms. This paper presents an overview of different approaches to motivate users to participate. These approaches are based on various theories from the area of social psychology and behavioral economics and involve rewards mechanisms, reputation, open group user modeling, and social visualization. Future trends are outlined towards convergence with the areas of persuasive systems design, adaptive/personalized systems, and intelligent social learning environments.},

The unique feature in CeLS's design is its ability to use learners' products from previous stages and to conduct complex, multi-stage, structured activities. CeLS provides a sample of content-free Activity Structures and a searchable domain of all the activities that were implemented with students. Teachers can explore these examples, adopt them for personal use and adapt their structure and content to suit their specific needs. If none of the existing pre-designed resources seems to suit the needs, they can create new structures using basic building blocks.},

It has been suggested that when perceived as informational, gamification elements, such as points, levels and leaderboards, may afford feelings of competence and hence enhance intrinsic motivation and promote performance gains. We conducted a 2~\texttimes~4 online experiment that systematically examined how points, leaderboards and levels, as well as participants' goal causality orientation influence intrinsic motivation, competence and performance (tag quantity and quality) in an image annotation task. Compared to a control condition, game elements did not significantly affect competence or intrinsic motivation, irrespective of participants' causality orientation. However, participants' performance did not mirror their intrinsic motivation, as points, and especially levels and leaderboard led to a significantly higher amount of tags generated compared to the control group. These findings suggest that in this particular study context, points, levels and leaderboards functioned as extrinsic incentives, effective only for promoting performance quantity.},

  title = {Measuring {{User Engagement}}},
  isbn = {978-1-62705-262-7},
  abstract = {User engagement refers to the quality of the user experience that emphasizes the positive aspects of interacting with an online application and, in particular, the desire to use that application longer and repeatedly. User engagement is a key concept in the design of online applications (whether for desktop, tablet or mobile), motivated by the observation that successful applications are not just used, but are engaged with. Users invest time, attention, and emotion in their use of technology, and seek to satisfy pragmatic and hedonic needs. Measurement is critical for evaluating whether online applications are able to successfully engage users, and may inform the design of and use of applications. User engagement is a multifaceted, complex phenomenon; this gives rise to a number of potential measurement approaches. Common ways to evaluate user engagement include using self-report measures, e.g., questionnaires; observational methods, e.g. facial expression analysis, speech analysis; n uro-physiological signal processing methods, e.g., respiratory and cardiovascular accelerations and decelerations, muscle spasms; and web analytics, e.g., number of site visits, click depth. These methods represent various trade-offs in terms of the setting (laboratory versus ``in the wild''), object of measurement (user behaviour, affect or cognition) and scale of data collected. For instance, small-scale user studies are deep and rich, but limited in terms of generalizability, whereas large-scale web analytic studies are powerful but negate users' motivation and context. The focus of this book is how user engagement is currently being measured and various considerations for its measurement. Our goal is to leave readers with an appreciation of the various ways in which to measure user engagement, and their associated strengths and weaknesses. We emphasize the multifaceted nature of user engagement and the unique contextual constraints that come to bear upon attempts to measure eng gement in different settings, and across different user groups and web domains. At the same time, this book advocates for the development of ``good'' measures and good measurement practices that will advance the study of user engagement and improve our understanding of this construct, which has become so vital in our wired world.

  abstract = {This paper presents the architecture and functionality of an extended and more flexible version of the WebCollage tool. WebCollage was initially developed as a teacher-supportive web-based editor to facilitate the design of structured collaborative activities, following the tenets of scripting theory. However, earlier versions of WebCollage did not cater for design flexibility, as the collaborative activity could not be adapted during runtime and provide personalized support to students on an as-needed basis. In this work we explain how adaptation functionality is integrated in the WebCollage tool, based on our previously presented and elaborated theoretical framework of adaptation patterns. An "adaptation pattern" is defined as a higher level description of a corrective intervention that an experienced teacher would implement during a session of collaborative learning, in order to respond to identified learners' needs and improve the learning conditions. This work presents how the adaptation pattern (AP) theoretical framework is operationalized and integrated the AP functionality in AP-WebCollage architecture and user interface. We discuss the technical enhancements and modifications related to this endeavor, commenting also on issues relevant to IMS-LD compatibility and the efficiency of the AP-WebCollage version as a flexible tool for the design of adaptive collaboration scripts.},

In this paper, we test the efficacy of natural language tutoring to teach and scaffold acquisition of these skills. We describe ProPL (Pro-PELL), a dialogue-based intelligent tutoring system that elicits goal decompositions and program plans from students in natural language. The system uses a variety of tutoring tactics that leverage students' intuitive understandings of the problem, how it might be solved, and the underlying concepts of programming. We report the results of a small-scale evaluation comparing students who used ProPL with a control group who read the same content. Our primary findings are that students who received tutoring from ProPL seem to have developed an improved ability to solve the composition problem and displayed behaviors that suggest they were able to think at greater levels of abstraction than students in the read-only group.},

  abstract = {OntoClean is an approach towards the formal evaluation of taxonomic relations in ontologies. The application of OntoClean consists of two main steps. First, concepts are tagged according to meta-properties known as rigidity, unity, dependency and identity. Second, the tagged concepts are checked according to predefined constraints to discover taxonomic errors. Although OntoClean is well documented in numerous publications, it is still used rather infrequently due to the high costs of application. Especially, the manual tagging of concepts with the correct meta-properties requires substantial efforts of highly experienced ontology engineers. In order to facilitate the use of OntoClean and to enable the evaluation of real-world ontologies, we provide AEON, a tool which automatically tags concepts with appropriate OntoClean meta-properties and performs the constraint checking. We use the Web as an embodiment of world knowledge, where we search for patterns that indicate how to properly tag concepts. We thoroughly evaluated our approach against a manually created gold standard. The evaluation shows the competitiveness of our approach while at the same time significantly lowering the costs. All of our results, i.e. the tool AEON as well as the experiment data, are publicly available.},

  abstract = {CSCL systems can benefit from using grids since they offer a common infrastructure enabling access to an extended pool of resources that can provide supercomputing capabilities as well as specific hardware resources. Adopting a service oriented architecture such as OGSA can further benefit CSCL systems, enabling increased flexibility to adapt and reuse learning software offered by third party providers. However, service discovery is a challenge for educators, since they cannot use their own domain abstractions to search for learning services that may support their educational settings. Common service discovery mechanisms, such as the Index Service or UDDI, provide limited discovery capabilities since they rely on keyword matching and cannot deal with the description of service properties. In order to address these drawbacks, formal semantics of ontologies can be employed to represent semantic descriptions of services that can be exploited for service discovery. This paper proposes an ontology of CSCL tools that uses meaningful learning abstractions to describe them. That ontology is the basis of a service discovery facility that is developed for allowing educators to search service-based CSCL tools using learning concepts.},

This method is described with special reference to the learning of essential aspects of an Information System. The innovative description of the aforementioned collaborative method within the LAMS system is based on the fact that: (a) the tasks assigned to the groups consist of investigation of real world scenarios, and not merely the study of learning material as is usually proposed, (b) adaptive techniques are integrated with the method and (c) for the design of the collaborative learning activity, an intuitive learning design tool such as the LAMS system is used. A research study was also conducted aiming the development of an empirical model to allow the implementation of the aforementioned adaptive STAD collaborative method within the context of an IT work place, namely; the Legal Council of the Hellenic State. In fact, the data gathered from this study were used to build the initial learning profile of the user \textendash{}that is needed for the implementation of Phase 2 of the previously mentioned adaptive STAD collaborative method- so that to be able to provide him/her personalized training, monitoring, scaffolding and evaluation.},

  abstract = {The Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, and Evaluate (ADDIE) process is used to introduce an approach to instruction design that has a proven record of success. Instructional Design: The ADDIE Approach is intended to serve as an overview of the ADDIE concept. The primary rationale for this book is to respond to the need for an instruction design primer that addresses the current proliferation of complex educational development models, particularly non-traditional approaches to learning, multimedia development and online learning environments. Many entry level instructional designers and students enrolled in related academic programs indicate they are better prepared to accomplish the challenging work of creating effective training and education materials after they have a thorough understanding of the ADDIE principles. However, a survey of instructional development applications indicate that the overwhelming majority of instructional design models are based on ADDIE, often do not present the ADDIE origins as part of their content, and are poorly applied by people unfamiliar with the ADDIE paradigm. The purpose of this book is to focus on fundamental ADDIE principles, written with a minimum of professional jargon. This is not an attempt to debate scholars or other educational professionals on the finer points of instructional design, however, the book's content is based on sound doctrine and supported by valid empirical research. The only bias toward the topic is that generic terms will be used as often as possible in order to make it easy for the reader to apply the concepts in the book to other specific situations.},

This type of personalization can be based on explicit measures of users׳ tendencies to comply to distinct persuasive strategies: measures based on standardized questionnaire scores of users. However, persuasion profiling can also be implemented using implicit, behavioral measures of user traits. We present three case studies involving the design, implementation, and field deployment of personalized persuasive technologies, and we detail four design requirements. In each case study we show how these design requirements are implemented. In the discussion we highlight avenues for future research in the field of adaptive persuasive technologies.},

The foundation for motivational theory and design was provided by the ARCS model (an acronym formed from attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction). This model provides a definition of motivation, a motivational design process, and recommendations for motivational strategies. Three treatment conditions were considered: (a) motivationally adaptive CAI, (b) motivationally saturated CAI, and (c) motivationally minimized CAI. Dependent variables were effectiveness, perceived motivation (both overall motivation and each of A, R, C, \& S components), efficiency, and continuing motivation. The motivationally adaptive CAI showed higher effectiveness, overall motivation, and attention than the other two CAI types. For efficiency, both motivationally adaptive CAI and motivationally minimized CAI were higher than motivationally saturated CAI. For continuing motivation, there were no significant differences among the three CAI types, but a significant correlation was found between overall motivation and continuing motivation across the three CAI types. This study supports the conclusion that CAI can be designed to be motivationally adaptive to respond to changes in learner motivation that may occur over time. It also illustrates that the ARCS model can be useful and effective in support of designing for these dynamic aspects of motivation.},

Some researchers suggest that it could also be used in web based education as a tool to increase student motivation and engagement. In an attempt to verify those theories, we have designed and built a gamification plugin for a well-known e-learning platform. We have made an experiment using this plugin in a university course, collecting quantitative and qualitative data in the process. Our findings suggest that some common beliefs about the benefits obtained when using games in education can be challenged. Students who completed the gamified experience got better scores in practical assignments and in overall score, but our findings also suggest that these students performed poorly on written assignments and participated less on class activities, although their initial motivation was higher.},

To accomplish this, it is necessary to understand the composition of this construct and how to evaluate it. Building on previous work that posited a theory of engagement and identified a core set of attributes that operationalized this construct, we constructed and evaluated a multidimensional scale to measure user engagement. In this paper we describe the development of the scale, as well as two large-scale studies (N=440 and N=802) that were undertaken to assess its reliability and validity in online shopping environments. In the first we used Reliability Analysis and Exploratory Factor Analysis to identify six attributes of engagement: Perceived Usability, Aesthetics, Focused Attention, Felt Involvement, Novelty, and Endurability. In the second we tested the validity of and relationships among those attributes using Structural Equation Modeling. The result of this research is a multidimensional scale that may be used to test the engagement of software applications. In addition, findings indicate that attributes of engagement are highly intertwined, a complex interplay of user-system interaction variables. Notably, Perceived Usability played a mediating role in the relationship between Endurability and Novelty, Aesthetics, Felt Involvement, and Focused Attention.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the application of a mixed-evaluation method, published elsewhere, to three different learning scenarios. The method defines how to combine social network analysis with qualitative and quantitative analysis in order to study participatory aspects of learning in CSCL contexts. The three case studies include a course-long, blended learning experience evaluated as the course develops; a course-long, distance learning experience evaluated at the end of the course; and a synchronous experience of a few hours duration. These scenarios show that the analysis techniques and data collection and processing tools are flexible enough to be applied in different conditions. In particular, SAMSA, a tool that processes interaction data to allow social network analysis, is useful with different types of interactions (indirect asynchronous or direct synchronous interactions) and different data representations. Furthermore, the predefined types of social networks and indexes selected are shown to be appropriate for measuring structural aspects of interaction in these CSCL scenarios. These elements are usable and their results comprehensible by education practitioners. Finally, the experiments show that the mixed-evaluation method and its computational tools allow researchers to efficiently achieve a deeper and more reliable evaluation through complementarity and the triangulation of different data sources. The three experiments described show the particular benefits of each of the data sources and analysis techniques.},

The main objective of this study is to clarify the research area concerned with human aspects of software engineering and to create a common platform for future research. In order to meet the objective, we propose a definition of the research area behavioral software engineering (BSE) and present results from a systematic literature review based on the definition.

The result indicates that there are knowledge gaps in the research area of behavioral software engineering and that earlier research has been focused on a few concepts, which have been applied to a limited number of software engineering areas. The individual studies have typically had a narrow perspective focusing on few concepts from a single unit of analysis. Further, the research has rarely been conducted in collaboration by researchers from both software engineering and social science.

Altogether, this review can help put a broader set of human aspects higher on the agenda for future software engineering research and practice.},

Handicapped by a lack of good theoretical framework, designers often assume that good quality instruction is by itself motivating (Keller, 1983). When motivation is considered, it is often simply seen as steps that must occur prior to instruction, such as "gaining attention" or "orienting the learners" rather than as a central element in the instructional design itself. Traditional instructional design is concerned with different issues from those of motivation. Instructional design focuses on learning, while motivation is concerned with emotional issues. Keller (1983) attempted bridge this gap between instructional and motivational issues. His theory however was limited due to the fact that it devoted little attention to other variables (Snelbecker, 1987). Keller's constructs, nonetheless...},

Recent years have witnessed an increasing number of such games, which treat players as a monolithic group by adopting a one-size-fits-all design approach. Studies of gameplay motivation have shown that this is a bad approach because a motivational approach that works for one individual may actually demotivate behavior in others. In an attempt to resolve this weakness, we conducted a large-scale study on 1,108 gamers to examine the persuasiveness of ten PT strategies that are commonly employed in persuasive game design, and the receptiveness of seven gamer personalities (gamer types identified by BrianHex) to the ten PT strategies. We developed models showing the receptiveness of the gamer types to the PT strategies and created persuasive profiles, which are lists of strategies that can be employed to motivate behavior for each gamer type. We then explored the differences between the models and, based on the results, proposed two approaches for data-driven persuasive game design. The first is the one-size-fits-all approach that will motivate a majority of gamers, while not demotivating any player. The second is the personalized approach that will best persuade a particular type of gamer. We also compiled a list of the best and the worst strategies for each gamer type. Finally, to bridge the gap between game design and PT researchers, we map common game mechanics to the persuasive system design strategies.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the literature related to the learning and teaching of debugging computer programs. Debugging is an important skill that continues to be both difficult for novice programmers to learn and challenging for computer science educators to teach. These challenges persist despite a wealth of important research on the subject dating back as far as the mid 1970s. Although the tools and languages novices use for writing programs today are notably different from those employed decades earlier, the basic problem-solving and pragmatic skills necessary to debug them effectively are largely similar. Hence, an understanding of the previous work on debugging can offer computer science educators insights into how to improve contemporary learning and teaching of debugging and may suggest directions for future research into this important area. This overview of the debugging literature is organized around four questions relevant to computer science educators and education researchers: What causes bugs to occur? What types of bugs occur? What is the debugging process? How can we improve the learning and teaching of debugging? We conclude with suggestions on using the existing literature both to facilitate pedagogical improvements to debugging education and to offer guidance for future research.

It discusses the structure of training blueprints for complex learning and associated instructional methods. The basic claim is that four interrelated components are essential in blueprints for complex learning: (a) learning tasks, (b) supportive information, (c) just-in-time (JIT) information, and (d) part-task practice. Instructional methods for each component are coupled to the basic learning processes involved in complex learning and a fully worked-out example of a training blueprint for ``searching for literature'' is provided.

  issn = {0747-5632},
  doi = {10.1016/j.chb.2017.01.036},
  abstract = {Gamification aims to implement game features in non-game contexts, with the goal of increasing the motivation of individuals performing a specific task or set of tasks. The tasks themselves, can focus on cognitive behavior change (e.g., overcoming anxiety) or physical behavior change (e.g., overcoming a shoulder injury). Current gamification methods primarily serve as guidelines and principles for the design of gamified applications. Moreover, these methods often overlook the complexity of actually implementing the game features and do not consider the effects that game features have on individuals' ability to perform a target task. A knowledge gap exists in understanding the tradeoffs between the complexity of implementing a game feature and the impact it has on increasing individuals' motivation and performance on a particular task or set of tasks. This paper presents a method for evaluating the complexity of implementing game features and the physical effort required to perform the tasks of the application, with a specific focus on physically-interactive gamified applications. Designers will gain a fundamental understanding of how the implementation of specific game features, contributes toward the objective of the application. A case study is presented that focuses on physically-interactive gamified applications in a virtual environment. Empirical results measuring the effects of game features on participants' performance are presented, which provide evidence in support of the metrics proposed in this study. Knowledge gained from this work will inform designers on how to manage their resources more efficiently and predict possible design issues (e.g., not meeting the objective of the application) while creating gamification applications.},

In contrast, the independent samples t-test, which is also a test of two groups, requires the single variable to be measured at the interval or ratio level, rather than the ordinal level, and to be normally distributed. We accordingly refer to the Mann-Whitney U test as the nonparametric version of the parametric t-test. Both tests require two independently sampled groups and assess whether two groups differ on a single, continuous variable. The two tests, however, differ on the assumed distribution. A nonparametric test assumes no specific distribution, whereas a parametric test assumes a specific distribution. Thus, the Mann-Whitney U is conceptually similar to the t-test for determining whether two sampled groups are from a single population. When data do not meet the parametric assumptions of the t-test, the Mann-Whitney U tends to be more appropriate.},

The same procedure was repeated one week later. Factor analysis followed by varimax rotation showed that three factors (Perceived Competence, Interest/enjoyment, and Effort/importance) explained 65.26\% of the total variance. Computed intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were .61 for the Perceived Competence subscale, .86 for the Interest/enjoyment, .60 for the Effort/importance, and .70 for the overall scale. The results, however, were modified when the sample was divided in two groups. The first represented small changes in perceived competence between the first and the second measurement, while the second one represented large changes between the two measurements. Recalculated intraclass correlation coefficients for individuals whose Perceived Competence score remained relatively stable yield a high value (.92), whereas individuals whose Perceived Competence changed yield an extremely low value (.60). It was concluded that the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory provides a temporally stable measure, given that perceived competence has not been markedly changed.},

Why we're addicted to certain websites and steal glances at our smartphones under the dinner table? Or why some people are able to find joy in difficult or repetitive jobs while others burn out? It's not the experiences themselves but the way they're structured that matters. All our lives we've been told that games are distractions\textemdash{}playful pastimes, but unrelated to success. In Game Frame, Aaron Dignan shows us that the opposite is true: games produce peak learning conditions and accelerated achievement. Here, the crucial connection between the games we love to play and the everyday tasks, goals, and dreams we have trouble realizing is illuminated. Aaron Dignan is the thirty-something founder of a successful digital strategy firm that studies the transformative power of technology in culture. He and his peers were raised on a steady diet of games and gadgets, ultimately priming them to challenge the status quo of the modern workplace. What they learned from games goes deeper than hand-eye coordination; instead, this generation intrinsically understands the value of adding the elements of games into everyday life. Game Frame is the first prescriptive explanation of what games mean to us, the human psychology behind their magnetic pull, and how we can use the lessons they teach as a framework to achieve our potential in business and beyond. Games are a powerful way to influence and change behavior in any setting. Here, Dignan outlines why games and play are such important trends in culture today, and how our technology, from our iPhones to our hybrid cars, primes us to be instinctive players. Game Frame tackles the challenging task of defining games and the mechanics that make games work from several perspectives, then explores these ideas through the lens of neuroscience. Finally, Dignan provides practical tips for using basic game mechanics in a variety of settings, such as motivating employees at work or encouraging children at home, giving readers the tools to develop their own games to solve problems in their everyday lives. Illuminated throughout with a series of real-world examples and hypothetical scenarios, Game Frame promises a crash course in game design and behavioral psychology that will leave the reader\textemdash{}and, by extension, the world itself\textemdash{}more productive. Revolutionary, visionary, practical, and time-tested, Game Frame will change the way you approach life.},

  abstract = {Early in this century, most empirically oriented psychologists believed that all motivation was based in the physiology of a set of non-nervous$\-$ system tissue needs. The theories of that era reflected this belief and used it in an attempt to explain an increasing number of phenomena. It was not until the 1950s that it became irrefutably clear that much of human motivation is based not in these drives, but rather in a set of innate psychological needs. Their physiological basis is less understood; and as concepts, these needs lend themselves more easily to psycho$\-$ logical than to physiological theorizing. The convergence of evidence from a variety of scholarly efforts suggests that there are three such needs: self-determination, competence, and interpersonal relatedness. This book is primarily about self-determination and competence (with particular emphasis on the former), and about the processes and structures that relate to these needs. The need for interpersonal relat$\-$ edness, while no less important, remains to be explored, and the findings from those explorations will need to be integrated with the present theory to develop a broad, organismic theory of human motivation. Thus far, we have articulated self-determination theory, which is offered as a working theory-a theory in the making. To stimulate the research that will allow it to evolve further, we have stated self-determination theory in the form of minitheories that relate to more circumscribed domains, and we have developed paradigms for testing predictions from the various minitheories.},

Subjects (N = 116) competed in a basketball free-throw shooting game, following which they completed the IMI. The LISREL VI computer program was employed to conduct a confirmatory factor analysis to assess the tenability of a five factor hierarchical model representing four first-order factors or dimensions and a second-order general factor representing intrinsic motivation. Indices of model acceptability tentatively suggest that the sport data adequately fit the hypothesized five factor hierarchical model. Alternative models were tested but did not result in significant improvements in the goodness-of-fit indices, suggesting the proposed model to be the most accurate of the models tested. Coefficient alphas for the four dimensions and the overall scale indicated adequate reliability. The results are discussed with regard to the importance of accurate assessment of psychological constructs and the use of linear structural equations in confirming the factor structures of measures.},

The most common statistic used in reliability analysis is Cronbach's alpha and an often quoted rule of thumb is a coefficient value above 0.7 is acceptable for psychological constructs. However, some researchers assert that the size of a Cronbach's alpha coefficient depends upon the number of items in the scale with scales with more items having higher coefficients. The advantage of carrying out a reliability analysis is that it can enable a researcher to treat a group of variables on the same subject as a single scale variable, reducing the complexity of further analysis and reducing the risk of Type I errors. However, student researchers often find it hard to obtain sample sizes of 300. The purpose of this worksheet is to advise students about how to go about trying to validate a scale with smaller sample sizes.},

We used a Monte Carlo procedure to systematically vary sample size, number of variables, number of components, and component saturation (i.e., the magnitude of the correlation between the observed variables and the components) in order to examine the conditions under which a sample component pattern becomes stable relative to the population pattern. We compared patterns by means of a single summary statistic, g\textendash{}2, and by means of direct pattern comparisons using the kappa statistic. Results indicated that, contrary to the popular rules, samples size as a function of the number of variables was not an important factor in determining stability. Component saturation and absolute sample size were the most important factors. To a lesser degree, the number of variables per component was also important, with variables per component producing more stable results.},

This research indicates that the performance of an estimator of the coefficient alpha depends not only on the sample size but also on the largest eigenvalue of the sample data set. Thus, when the largest eigenvalue increases, unbiased estimation of the population coefficient alpha is possible, even  though the sample size is small.

Authors of the present study argue that the results of these studies did not conclusively support the hierarchical model and that the model did not accurately reflect the tenets of cognitive evaluation theory (Deci \& Ryan, 1985) from which the IMI is drawn. It is also argued that a measure of perceived locus of causality is required to model intrinsic motivation properly. The development of a perceived locus of causality for exercise scale is described, and alternative models, in which perceived competence and perceived locus of causality are held to have causal influences on intrinsic motivation, are compared with an oblique confirmatory factor analytic model in which the constructs are held at the same conceptual level. Structural equation modeling showed support for a causal model in which perceived locus of causality mediates the effects of perceived competence on pressure-tension, interest-enjoyment, and effort-importance. It is argued that conceptual and operational problems with the IMI, as currently used, should be addressed before it becomes established as the instrument of choice for assessing levels of intrinsic motivation.},

The aim of this study is to analyze the characteristics of IMI among Portuguese students, testing four organizational models (unidimensional, multidimensional, hierarchical and bi-factor). A total of 3685 students from the 5th to the 12th grades (50.4\% boys) participated in the study (M = 13.67, SD = 2.26). Two versions of IMI were used (First Language and Mathematics) with twenty-one items distributed over five subscales: Enjoyment, Perceived Competence, Pressure/Tension, Perceived Choice and Value/Utility. The confirmatory factor analysis corroborated the multidimensionality of intrinsic motivation, and that the bi-factor model presented the best fit indexes. This model showed the existence of one general factor, resulting from the contribution of all individual dimensions and the particularities of most of them. Furthermore, results also highlighted satisfactory reliability scores both through Cronbach's alpha scores and Composite reliability scores. These results indicate that this scale is appropriate to evaluate the underlying constructs of the theoretical model of SDT and allows for the calculation of a global measure of intrinsic motivation, as well as specific measures for their predictors.Key words: Intrinsic motivation; mathematics; first language; self-determination theory},

A quasi-experimental design was used to examine the effect of external rewards in one group (n~=~50) compared to a control group without such rewards (n~=~56). According to the results, the external rewards did not undermine students' motivation (e.g., at proximal and distal levels), however they did not foster disciplinary engagement. On the other hand, students in the reward condition showed significantly larger gains in conceptual understanding (proximal) and non-significantly larger gains in achievement (distal). These results suggest that the predicted negative consequences of external rewards may be addressed in this new generation of learning environments.

Task engagement and self-reported intrinsic motivation were compared between groups. Results demonstrate that the effects of simply framing the activity as a game though vernacular and artifacts holds almost as much psychological power as the full game mechanics. In both game conditions, interest and enjoyment were significantly superior to controls, but other intrinsic motivation variables remained unchanged. Implications for game design in nongame contexts are discussed, and a framework for differentiating ``deep and shallow gamification'' in terms of mechanics and framing is developed.},

  abstract = {Online discussions provide opportunities for learners to engage in argumentative debate, but learners rarely formulate well-grounded arguments or benefit individually from participating in online discussions. Learners often do not explicitly warrant their arguments and fail to construct counterarguments (incomplete formal argumentation structure), which is hypothesized to impede individual knowledge acquisition. Computer-supported scripts have been found to support learners during online discussions. Such scripts can support specific discourse activities, such as the construction of single arguments, by supporting learners in explicitly warranting their claims or in constructing specific argumentation sequences, e.g., argument--counterargument sequences, during online discussions. Participation in argumentative discourse is seen to promote both knowledge on argumentation and domain-specific knowledge. However, there have been few empirical investigations regarding the extent to which computer-supported collaboration scripts can foster the formal quality of argumentation and thereby facilitate the individual acquisition of knowledge. One hundred and twenty (120) students of Educational Science participated in the study with a 2thinspace\texttimes{}thinspace2-factorial design (with vs. without script for the construction of single arguments and with vs. without script for the construction of argumentation sequences) and were randomly divided into groups of three. Results indicated that the collaboration scripts could improve the formal quality of single arguments and the formal quality of argumentation sequences in online discussions. Scripts also facilitated the acquisition of knowledge on argumentation, without affecting the acquisition of domain-specific knowledge.},

In the current paper, we first review prominent emotion theories and models with respect to learning, detection techniques and affective feedback strategies, and then we present a system's design and implementation that provides collaborators with a usable, web tool for self-reporting of emotions. In response to the user's emotions, the system activates an animated, virtual assistant that employs expressive faces and synthesised speech to provide affective and task-based feedback. The specific tool was customised and adapted to the virtualised collaborative session (VCS) system for the needs of an experiment that we run in the Open University of Catalonia. The respective results and findings are presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {Gamification has been widely used in education with mixed results. Some empirical findings indicate that gamification can increase motivation and engagement in students; other findings highlight that gamification can be a distraction to students; and therefore it may end up hindering learning. To deal with this problem, it is necessary to design gamification to fit properly in individual and collaborative learning contexts. Unfortunately, there is a lack of studies on frameworks mapping game elements and learning theories to support the adequate design and application of gamification in education. Moreover, most proposed solutions do not take into account the need for personalized gamification. To bridge this gap, we set out to create models and a vocabulary to represent learner-player roles interactions in gamified collaborative learning contexts. We developed a conceptual framework using these models and the vocabulary. To demonstrate the framework's viability to design theory-based gamified collaborative learning scenarios, we describe a case study using the theory Peer Tutoring. Our conceptual framework is an effort to support the development of social software tailored towards improving the learners' interactions, providing rich and systematic new ways to learn and to explore the knowledge.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT While gamification is gaining ground in business, marketing, corporate management, and wellness initiatives, its application in education is still an emerging trend. This article presents a study of the published empirical research on the application of gamification to education. The study is limited to papers that discuss explicitly the effects of using game elements in specific educational contexts. It employs a systematic mapping design. Accordingly, a categorical structure for classifying the research results is proposed based on the extracted topics discussed in the reviewed papers. The categories include gamification design principles, game mechanics, context of applying gamification (type of application, educational level, and academic subject), implementation, and evaluation. By mapping the published works to the classification criteria and analyzing them, the study highlights the directions of the currently conducted empirical research on applying gamification to education. It also indicates some major obstacles and needs, such as the need for proper technological support, for controlled studies demonstrating reliable positive or negative results of using specific game elements in particular educational contexts, etc. Although most of the reviewed papers report promising results, more substantial empirical research is needed to determine whether both extrinsic and intrinsic motivation of the learners can be influenced by gamification.},

  abstract = {There is an increase use of ontology-driven approaches to support requirements engineering (RE) activities, such as elicitation, analysis, specification, validation and management of requirements. However, the RE community still lacks a comprehensive understanding of how ontologies are used in RE process. Thus, the main objective of this work is to investigate and better understand how ontologies support RE as well as identify to what extent they have been applied to this field. In order to meet our goal, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify the primary studies on the use of ontologies in RE, following a predefined review protocol. We then identified the main RE phases addressed, the requirements modelling styles that have been used in conjunction with ontologies, the types of requirements that have been supported by the use of ontologies and the ontology languages that have been adopted. We also examined the types of contributions reported and looked for evidences of the benefits of ontology-driven RE. In summary, the main findings of this work are: (1) there are empirical evidences of the benefits of using ontologies in RE activities both in industry and academy, specially for reducing ambiguity, inconsistency and incompleteness of requirements; (2) the majority of studies only partially address the RE process; (3) there is a great diversity of RE modelling styles supported by ontologies; (4) most studies addressed only functional requirements; (5) several studies describe the use/development of tools to support different types of ontology-driven RE approaches; (6) about half of the studies followed W3C recommendations on ontology-related languages; and (7) a great variety of RE ontologies were identified; nevertheless, none of them has been broadly adopted by the community. Finally, we conclude this work by showing several promising research opportunities that are quite important and interesting but underexplored in current research and practice.},

  abstract = {Several studies have indicated the need for personalizing gamified systems to users' personalities. However, mapping user personality onto design elements is difficult. Hexad is a gamification user types model that attempts this mapping but lacks a standard procedure to assess user preferences. Therefore, we created a 24-items survey response scale to score users' preferences towards the six different motivations in the Hexad framework. We used internal and test-retest reliability analysis, as well as factor analysis, to validate this new scale. Further analysis revealed significant associations of the Hexad user types with the Big Five personality traits. In addition, a correlation analysis confirmed the framework's validity as a measure of user preference towards different game design elements. This scale instrument contributes to games user research because it enables accurate measures of user preference in gamification.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper explores the opportunities and challenges associated with implementing a digital badge system that awards high school credit for students' participation in afterschool programs serving non-dominant youth. Data include interviews and focus groups with 43 students, and interviews with 24 teachers and afterschool mentors and one college admissions director. Across all stakeholders, the most frequently cited opportunity related to the potential that badges hold for establishing learners' credibility outside the context in which their badges were earned by providing a trustworthy record of the skills and achievements that students gain through their participation in the afterschool programs. However, credibility also emerged as the dominant challenge associated with digital badges. Participants observed that in order for badges to succeed in proving one's credibility to external audiences, these audiences\textemdash{}such as college admissions officers and employers\textemdash{}must know about and recognize the validity of badges. Students, teachers, and program staff all expressed the belief that this essential criterion had not yet been achieved. We examine these findings in light of theory and research on the role of artifacts within and outside the communities of practice in which they were created and used. The findings hold implications for designers of openly networked learning environments that seek to span and connect diverse social settings.},

  isbn = {978-3-319-45153-4},
  abstract = {Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) have been largely used in school settings and considered effective learning tools. However, students' performance might be impaired by their undesired behaviors. An example of these behaviors is ‘‘gaming the system'', which happens when the student tries to mislead the system in order to advance faster in the tasks. Previous works have tried to treat this behavior by blocking student's actions; however, this restrictive approach has proved to be ineffective. We propose the use of animated pedagogical agents in ITSs as a non-restrictive approach to gaming the system. We believe that an animated pedagogical agent can discourage this behavior by taking two actions: (1) showing it is aware of when students are gaming, and (2) educating students about the negative impact of this behavior on their learning. We implemented this approach in a step-based algebra ITS, and a classroom experiment was conducted with 37 students who used the system for 50~min on average to solve linear equations. Although, due to the design restrictions of the experiment, we could not statistically demonstrate that the presence of the agent decreased the gaming of the system, descriptive statistics of the tutor log data show evidence of a possible positive effect of an aware animated pedagogical agent on students' behavior, indicating that this approach deserves further investigation.},

Using a general input\textendash{}process\textendash{}output model, the authors examined 15 team-level variables researched in primary studies published over the last 30 years and their relation to creativity and innovation. An exhaustive search of the international innovation literature resulted in a final sample (k) of 104 independent studies. Results revealed that team process variables of support for innovation, vision, task orientation, and external communication displayed the strongest relationships with creativity and innovation ($\rho$s between 0.4 and 0.5). Input variables (i.e., team composition and structure) showed weaker effect sizes. Moderator analyses confirmed that relationships differ substantially depending on measurement method (self-ratings vs. independent ratings of innovation) and measurement level (individual vs. team innovation). Team variables displayed considerably stronger relationships with self-report measures of innovation compared with independent ratings and objective criteria. Team process variables were more strongly related to creativity and innovation measured at the team than the individual level. Implications for future research and pragmatic ramifications for organizational practice are discussed in conclusion. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Second is to demonstrate methods to explore how violations of the unidimensionality requirement influence person measurement. For the first study, rating scale data were simulated to represent varying degrees of multidimensionality and the proportion of items contributing to each component. The second study used responses to a 24 item Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder scale obtained from 317 college undergraduates. The simulation study reveals both an iterative item fit approach and principal component analysis of standardized residuals are effective in detecting items simulated to contribute to multidimensionality. The methods presented in Study 2 demonstrate the potential impact of multidimensionality on norm and criterion-reference person measure interpretations. The results provide researchers with quantitative information to help assist with the qualitative judgment as to whether the impact of multidimensionality is severe enough to warrant removing items from the analysis.},

The proposed specification is pedagogically neutral and provides a means for defining diverse learning designs (e. g.: collaborative learning, problem-based learning, blended learning). Regardless of the pedagogy involved, in practice every learning design comes to: a Method prescribing various Activities for learner and academic staff Actors in a certain order. We agree with this proposal, but we have found some deficiencies and limitations in the way these elements are described. Considering ideas and solutions of the Activity Theory (AT) and the Workflow Management Systems (WFMS) domain we propose alternative structures to describe the Activity and Method parts of this specification.},

Our framework comprises a design specification and an implementation of adaptations in CSCL (computer-supported collaborative learning) oriented and standards based architecture. The architecture allows combining existing research on explicit representations of collaborative learning processes (i.e. learning designs) with the availability of existing and tested collaborative learning tools (e.g. a forum in a virtual learning environment (VLE), an agent, a service or even a software component that provides a specific functionality). The architecture allows controlling the learning tools either by a human or a pedagogical agent and thus enables adaptive interventions to the flow of the learning activity. A mediator component is the key element in the proposed architecture. To prove the soundness of the architecture and the flexibility of its implementation example scenarios are illustrated. In these scenarios IMS-LD based modeling and Coppercore engine are used to implement adaptations by setting IMS-LD properties according to input from an external Moodle forum tool. The whole process is mediated by an integration component provided to the teacher as a Moodle resource. Finally, we highlight what would be important issues toward integrating the adaptation pattern capabilities in IMS-LD compliant tools for collaborative learning design.},

We propose a pedagogical model for the designing of scripts and illustrate this model using three scripts. In brief, a script disturbs the natural convergence of a team and in doing so increases the intensity of interaction required between team members for the completion of their collaborative task. The nature of the perturbation determines the types of interactions that are necessary for overcoming it: for instance, if a script provides students with conflicting evidence, more argumentation is required before students can reach an agreement. Tools for authoring scripts manipulate abstract representations of the script components and the mechanisms that relate components to one another. These mechanisms are encompassed in the transformation of data structures (social structure, resources structure and products structure) between script phases. We describe how this pedagogical design model is translated into computational structures in three illustrated scripts.},

  abstract = {Scripting collaborative learning is an effective approach to promoting learning in both face-to-face and on-line computer learning contexts. Although the term script originated in cognitive psychology, it is used in educational contexts to describe ways of structuring interaction and scaffolding collaborative learning through the use of roles, activities, and sequencing of activities. There are several specific types of learning activities that numerous lines of research have shown enhance learning during interaction, however, these activities rarely occur spontaneously during naturally-occurring group collaboration. Also, it is not always clear what individuals learn during collaboration, how they learn it, and the underlying cognitive mechanisms that account for learning collaboratively. Four illustrative approaches to scripting face-to-face collaboration are presented. Each approach is examined to reveal how roles, activities, and sequence of activities, are used to structure collaborative learning and what particular cognitive, metacognitive, and socio-cognitive processes their scripts are intended to induce in learners. The expectation for some scripts is that over time learners will internalize the roles, activities, and sequence; and, once learners can play all of the roles of a script on their own, they will self-regulate their learning without the aid of an external script. However, the wide range of differences in both the complexity and goals of scripts affects their potential for internalization, and some external scripts are not intended to be discontinued even if roles are internalized.},

  abstract = {Elements of measurement theory have recently been introduced into the software engineering discipline. It has been suggested that these elements should serve as the basis for developing, reasoning about, and applying measures. For example, it has been suggested that software complexity measures should be additive, that measures fall into a number of distinct types (i.e., levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio), that certain statistical techniques are not appropriate for certain types of measures (e.g., parametric statistics for less-than-interval measures), and that certain transformations are not permissible for certain types of measures (e.g., non-linear transformations for interval measures). In this paper we argue that, inspite of the importance of measurement theory, and in the context of software engineering, many of these prescriptions and proscriptions are either premature or, if strictly applied, would represent a substantial hindrance to the progress of empirical research in software engineering. This argument is based partially on studies that have been conducted by behavioral scientists and by statisticians over the last five decades. We also present a pragmatic approach to the application of measurement theory in software engineering. While following our approach may lead to violations of the strict prescriptions and proscriptions of measurement theory, we demonstrate that in practical terms these violations would have diminished consequences, especially when compared to the advantages afforded to the practicing researcher.},

The conceptual schema for this research was the uses-and-gratifications perspective. The males in the sample played video games at twice the weekly average of the females, were consistently stronger in all measured motives than the females, and preferred physically oriented video games over the females' preference for more traditional, thoughtful games. Younger players opted for the fantasy motive in their playing and older players more so for competition. Preference for physical games declined among the older males, and generally motives were stronger in the middle years of playing for both males and females than in the youngest and oldest age groups. Regression analyses explained considerably more variance in game playing for males than for females.},

  abstract = {The demand for minority representation in video games often focuses on proving that members of marginalized groups are gamers. In turn, it is asserted that the gaming industry should focus on appealing to these players via targeted content. Being targeted as a gamer, however, does not a gamer make. Identity as a gamer intersects with other identities like gender, race, and sexuality. Negative connotations about gaming lead people to not identify as gamers, and even to not play video games. This article concludes, based on interview data, that those invested in diversity in video games must focus their attention on the construction of the medium, and not the construction of the audience as such. This shift in academic attention is necessary to develop arguments for representation in games that do not rely on marking groups as specific kinds of gaming markets via identifiers like gender, race, and sexuality.},

Nevertheless, online game players may have diverse motivations for playing online games, which in turn influence their behaviors and preferences in playing online games. Through factor analysis for dimensionality reduction, this study identifies two underlying motivational factors: (1) the need for exploration, and (2) the need for aggression. From these two factors, this study clusters online gamers into three segments: (1) the aggressive gamers, (2) the social gamers, and (3) the inactive gamers. The aggressive gamers score highest on both factors. The social gamers score high on the first factor, but score lowest on the second factor. The inactive gamers score lowest on the first factor, and score in the middle on the second factor. Significant differences exist in consumer behaviors across different segments of online gamers. Theoretical supports for the two motivational factors are discussed, and managerial implications for online game service firms are provided.},

  abstract = {Abstract The ratio of subjects to variables (N/p), as a rule to calculate the sample size required in internal validity studies on measurement scales, has been recommended without any strict theoretical or empirical basis being provided. The purpose of the present study was to develop a tool to determine sample size for these studies in the field of psychiatry. First, a literature review was carried out to identify the distinctive features of psychiatric scales. Then, two simulation methods were developed to generate data according to: (1) the model for factor structure derived from the literature review and (2) a real dataset. This enabled the study of the quality of solutions obtained from principal component analysis or Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) on various sample sizes. Lastly, the influence of sample size on the precision of Cronbach's alpha coefficient was examined. The N/p ratio rule is not upheld by this study: short scales do not allow smaller sample size. As a rule of thumb, if one's aim is to reveal the factor structure, a minimum of 300 subjects is generally acceptable but should be increased when the number of factors within the scale is large, when EFA is used and when the number of items is small.

Results revealed that factor loadings and robust standard errors were generally most accurately estimated using cat-LS, especially with fewer than 5 categories; however, factor correlations and model fit were assessed equally well with ML. Cat-LS was found to be more sensitive to sample size and to violations of the assumption of normality of the underlying continuous variables. Normal theory ML was found to be more sensitive to asymmetric category thresholds and was especially biased when estimating large factor loadings. Accordingly, we recommend cat-LS for data sets containing variables with fewer than 5 categories and ML when there are 5 or more categories, sample size is small, and category thresholds are approximately symmetric. With 6\textendash{}7 categories, results were similar across methods for many conditions; in these cases, either method is acceptable. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Robust ML (MLR) has been introduced into CFA models when this normality assumption is slightly or moderately violated. Diagonally weighted least squares (WLSMV), on the other hand, is specifically designed for ordinal data. Although WLSMV makes no distributional assumptions about the observed variables, a normal latent distribution underlying each observed categorical variable is instead assumed. A Monte Carlo simulation was carried out to compare the effects of different configurations of latent response distributions, numbers of categories, and sample sizes on model parameter estimates, standard errors, and chi-square test statistics in a correlated two-factor model. The results showed that WLSMV was less biased and more accurate than MLR in estimating the factor loadings across nearly every condition. However, WLSMV yielded moderate overestimation of the interfactor correlations when the sample size was small or/and when the latent distributions were moderately nonnormal. With respect to standard error estimates of the factor loadings and the interfactor correlations, MLR outperformed WLSMV when the latent distributions were nonnormal with a small sample size of N = 200. Finally, the proposed model tended to be over-rejected by chi-square test statistics under both MLR and WLSMV in the condition of small sample size N = 200.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS) purports to assess the motivational characteristics of instructional materials or courses using the Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction (ARCS) model of motivation. The IMMS has received little use or study in medical education. The authors sought to evaluate the validity of IMMS scores and compare scores between standard and adaptive Web-based learning modules.
METHOD: During the 2005-2006 academic year, 124 internal medicine residents at the Mayo School of Graduate Medical Education (Rochester, Minnesota) were asked to complete the IMMS for two Web-based learning modules. Participants were randomly assigned to use one module that adapted to their prior knowledge of the topic, and one module using a nonadaptive design. IMMS internal structure was evaluated using Cronbach alpha and interdimension score correlations. Relations to other variables were explored through correlation with global module satisfaction and regression with knowledge scores.
RESULTS: Of the 124 eligible participants, 79 (64\%) completed the IMMS at least once. Cronbach alpha was $>$or=0.75 for scores from all IMMS dimensions. Interdimension score correlations ranged 0.40 to 0.80, whereas correlations between IMMS scores and global satisfaction ratings ranged 0.40 to 0.63 (P$<$.001). Knowledge scores were associated with Attention and Relevance subscores (P=.033 and .01, respectively) but not with other IMMS dimensions (P$>$or=.07). IMMS scores were similar between module designs (on a five-point scale, differences ranged from 0.0 to 0.15, P$>$or=.33).
CONCLUSIONS: These limited data generally support the validity of IMMS scores. Adaptive and standard Web-based instructional designs were similarly motivating. Cautious use and further study of the IMMS are warranted.},

Rating scale data are defined as responses scored in two or more ordered categories. Rating scale data represent the most common formats for collecting information from examinees or raters. The basic idea that motivates the use of IRT models for rating scale data is that the scoring of m + 1 ordered categories with ordered integers (0, 1, \ldots, m) using the assumption that there are equal intervals between the categories may not be justified. IRT models provide a framework to explicitly examine this assumption, and parameterize the categories without this assumption. The specific IRT models that are described in this entry are direct models (Partial Credit Model, Generalized Partial Credit, and Rating Scale Model) and indirect models (Graded Response Model and Modified Graded Response Model). Graphical procedures are used to illustrate various aspects of these IRT models.},

After reviewing many indices, it is suggested that those based on the size of residuals after fitting a two- or three-parameter latent trait model may be the most useful to detect unidimensionality. An attempt is made to clarify the term unidimensional, and it is shown how it differs from other terms often used inter changeably such as reliability, internal consistency, and homogeneity. Reliability is defined as the ratio of true score variance to observed score variance. Inter nal consistency denotes a group of methods that are intended to estimate reliability, are based on the vari ances and the covariances of test items, and depend on only one administration of a test. Homogeneity seems to refer more specifically to the similarity of the item correlations, but the term is often used as a synonym for unidimensionality. The usefulness of the terms in ternal consistency and homogeneity is questioned. Uni dimensionality is defined as the existence of one latent trait underlying the data.},

Test length, sample size, and the type of correlation matrix (used in factor analysis for selecting ATI subset items) were varied in Type I error analyses. For the power study, the correlation between Os and the item-0 loadings were also varied. The results showed that PD was able to confirm unidimensionality for unidimensional simulated test data, with the average observed level of significance slightly below the nominal level. PD was also highly effective in detecting lack of unidimensionality in various two-dimensional tests. As expected, power increased as the sample size and test length increased, and the correlation between the Os decreased. The results also demonstrated that use of Pearson correlations to select ATI items led to equally good or better performance than using polychoric correlations; therefore Pearson correlations are recommended for future use.},

The theory provides a theoretical foundation for dimensionality assessment procedures based on conditional covariances or correlations, such as DETECT and DIMTEST, so that the performance of these procedures is theoretically justified when applied to response data with polytomous items. Various estimators of conditional covariances are constructed, and special attention is paid to the case of complex sampling data, such as those from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). As such, the new version of DETECT can be applied to response data sets not only with polytomous items but also with missing values, either by design or at random. DETECT is then applied to analyze the dimensional structure of the 2002 NAEP reading samples of grades 4 and 8. The DETECT results show that the substantive test structure based on the purposes for reading is consistent with the statistical dimensional structure for either grade.},

A new method, weighted likelihood estimation (WLE), is derived, and proved to be less biased than maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with the same asymptotic variance and normal distribution. WLE removes the first order bias term from MLE. Two Monte Carlo studies compare WLE with MLE and Bayesian modal estimation (BME) of ability in conventional tests and tailored tests, assuming the item parameters are known constants. The Monte Carlo studies favor WLE over MLE and BME on several criteria over a wide range of the ability scale.},

  abstract = {In this article we show how certain analytic problems that arise when one attempts to use latent variables as outcomes in regression analyses can be addressed by taking a multilevel perspective on item response modeling. Under a multilevel, or hierarchical, perspective we cast the item response model as a within-student model and the student population distribution as a between-student model. Taking this perspective leads naturally to an extension of the student population model to include a range of student-level variables, and it invites the possibility of further extending the models to additional levels so that multilevel models can be applied with latent outcome variables. In the two-level case, the model that we employ is formally equivalent to the plausible value procedures that are used as part of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), but we present the method for a different class of measurement models, and we use a simultaneous estimation method rather than two-step estimation. In our application of the models to the appropriate treatment of measurement error in the dependent variable of a between-student regression, we also illustrate the adequacy of some approximate procedures that are used in NAEP.},

Our representation of systematic individual differences in growth is built up in two parts: (a) a model for individual growth and, (b) a model for the dependence of parameters in the individual growth models on individual characteristics. First, explicit representations of correlates of change are constructed for various models of individual growth. Second, for the special case of initial status as a correlate of change, properties of collections of growth curves provide new results on the relation between change and initial status. Third, the shortcomings of previous approaches to the assessment of correlates of change are demonstrated. In particular, correlations of residual change measures with exogenous individual characteristics are shown to be poor indicators of systematic individual differences in growth.},
