Foremost, I want to thank my PhD advisor, Prof. Seiji Isotani, whose encouragement, guidance, and persistent help was crucial and important to finish my research work.
I would also like to thank Prof. Riichiro Mizoguchi and Prof. Ig Ibert Bittencourt who gives me invaluable insightful, comments and suggestions to better address my research.
They are three persons who becomes my example of what means to be a good researcher. Someday, when I grow up, I want to be a little like them.

My special thanks to my friend and collegues from the Applied Computing in Education Laboratory at the University of São Paulo (CAED - USP), Rachel, Kamila, Simone, Cida, Fernando, Helena, Wilmax, Carla and Leonardo, without feedback, comments, suggestions and encouragement, this research would not be reality.
